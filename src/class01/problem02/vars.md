# Variables in rust

- They are immutable by default.
- Defined using `let` keyword
- They can be mutable using the `mut` keyword
- Hold primitive data or references to data
- Rust is block-scoped
- There is a `const` keyword, not as used.
  - `const` vars must be explicitly typed.
  - Convention for const: uppercase
- Destructuring assignment works

Note: The special named palceholders of `println!` do not extend to vars
